Truly simple Rust project to make it easier to use the SysLinks (directory ones at least) in Windows.

### INSTALL

build the Rust project using "cargo build --release" -> make create-sys-link.exe(target/release/create-sys-link.exe) always run as admin (right click -> compatibility -> change settings for all users -> run this program as an administrator) -> run it to create necessary registry entries
