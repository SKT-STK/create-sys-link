Truly simple Rust project to make it easier to use the SysLinks (directory ones at least) in Windows.

### INSTALL

build the Rust project using "cargo build --release" -> open registry editor -> HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell -> create new key "create-sys-link" -> in the (Default) value type the name that is to be displayed in the right click context menu -> then create another key inside "create-sys-link" called "command" and in its (Default) value paste: "powershell Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "& {YOUR_PATH\target\release\create-sys-link.exe %V}"'"" (without the most outer quotation marks, and remember to change YOUR_PATH to the actual path which you have downloaded and builded the .zip in (cannot contain ') (must use backslashes)) -> do the same at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell -> reboot your system -> (sometimes might require clicking the right click context menu option 2 times (idk why, i guess just the beauty of win11))
